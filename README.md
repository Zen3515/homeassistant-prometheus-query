## Configuration

To enable it, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: prometheus_query
    name: Temperature Pisa
    unique_id: sensorEntityId
    prometheus_url: http://localhost:9090
    prometheus_query: temperature{location="Pisa",province="PI",region="Tuscany"}
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    state_class: total_increasing
    device_class: temperature
```
